ldesc: "This application allows you to capture the entire screen, the 
active window or a selected region. You can set the delay that elapses 
before the screenshot is taken and the action that will be done with the 
screenshot: save it to a PNG file, copy it to the clipboard, open it 
using another application, or host it on ZimageZ, a free online image 
hosting service."
